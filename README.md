# Aliens-From-Another-Planet-
A practice game on everything I have learned thus far.

STORY:
You and your sister are going out for a walk in the forest harvesting some berries to make at home. Suddenly, a UFO appears,, and a foreign being comes down from above. It speaks to you in some language, and claims that they call themselves Akantors...apparently. Otherwise, the language was unfamiliar to you and by some weird magic, it teleports your sister to his side and he takes her away. You can sense your sister is still in the forest, so you take your bow and arrow and follow the trail in the woods...
